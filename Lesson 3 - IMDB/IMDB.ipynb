       "'This is a extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.<br /><br />But it is hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it\\'s also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends.<br /><br />The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation.<br /><br />There is redemption of a sort, in the end, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great pain for her.<br /><br />This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to \"Mr & Mrs Iyer\".<br /><br />In the end, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off.'"

       "xxbos xxmaj if you check the other comments , you 'll hear about this being a great romantic comedy . xxmaj it 's not . xxmaj as a romantic comedy , it barely passes muster . xxmaj the laughs are few and far between , the plot is completely formulaic , and the only thing \" xxmaj national xxmaj lampoon \" about this film is the title . xxmaj douglas is wooden as xxmaj adam , although xxmaj chriqui is very convincing as xxmaj eve . xxmaj the frat - house shenanigans are tame beyond belief when compared to other xxmaj lampoon college movies , and the girl waiting for the perfect time to toss in her v - card is an old theme that is n't xxunk in any way by this film . xxmaj after great xxmaj national xxmaj lampoon titles like \" xxmaj van xxmaj wilder \" , \" xxmaj animal xxmaj house \" , and the \" xxmaj vacation \" movies , this one feels like the first attempt of someone straight out of film school .,xxbos xxmaj richard xxmaj harris is xxmaj sean xxmaj kilpatrick , the unlikely sheriff of a small xxmaj texas town who always tries to avoid violence . xxmaj however , he undergoes a major change of heart once xxmaj frank xxmaj brand ( an excellent xxmaj rod xxmaj taylor ) , a cold - blooded outlaw , and his nasty gang , cause a ruckus in his town , and lead to the deaths of xxmaj kilpatrick 's wife and son . xxmaj kilpatrick relentlessly tracks them down , even as they cross the border into xxmaj mexico , where xxmaj kilpatrick 's progress is both helped and hindered by xxmaj mexican policeman xxmaj gutierrez ( xxmaj al xxmaj lettieri ) , who is also after xxmaj brand but wants to do things the legal way . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj while this xxmaj western ( from a story by xxmaj samuel xxmaj fuller , also the original director but fired after disputes with star xxmaj harris ) wo n't be for everybody because of its grim and sometimes ugly nature , there 's no doubt that it hits a real nerve . xxmaj it does n't glorify vigilantism and instead works as an examination of how an obsession with \" justice \" can lead basically good people down a very dark path . xxmaj as the movie goes on , xxmaj kilpatrick displays a newfound proclivity towards ruthlessness . ( xxmaj perhaps most interesting is having xxmaj brand display a touch of humanity late in the movie as he tries to reach out to his own daughter . ) xxmaj it also serves as a good contrast between conflicting ideas as xxmaj kilpatrick and xxmaj gutierrez strike up their rather volatile relationship . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj excellent widescreen photography is one asset ; a most amusing supporting cast is another . xxmaj neville xxmaj brand is great as \" xxmaj choo xxmaj choo \" , so named for a rail tie at the end of one limb where his hand used to be . xxmaj william xxmaj smith is interesting as the thuggish but seemingly mentally challenged \" xxmaj schoolboy \" , and xxmaj paul xxmaj benjamin is fine as xxmaj jacob , the dapper black gentleman who for whatever unfathomable reason rides with these men and puts up with a lot of their nonsense . xxmaj but xxmaj taylor is the most fun as the swaggering lowlife who puts the whole plot into motion . \n",
